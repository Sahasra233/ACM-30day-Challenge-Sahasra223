🔁 Redemption Cycle – Phase 1

✅ Tasks Completed:
🔹 Loaded and merged books.csv and ratings.csv from the Goodbooks-10K dataset

🔹 Created binary labels: rating ≥ 4 → 1 (likely to finish), else 0 (likely to drop)

🔹 Selected key input features: average_rating and rating

🔹 Normalized the input features using StandardScaler

🔹 Built a custom Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model in PyTorch

🔹 Used ReLU for hidden layers and Sigmoid for the output layer

🔹 Trained the model using Binary Cross Entropy Loss

🔹 Visualized the training loss over epochs using matplotlib

🔹 Evaluated the model using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

🔹 Identified the model’s performance and confirmed successful classification
