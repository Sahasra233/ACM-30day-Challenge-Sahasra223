# Day 03 – Classifier Arena 🧠⚔️

## ✅ Tasks Completed:
- Loaded cleaned and preprocessed burnout dataset from Day 2
- Split the dataset into training and test sets (80/20)
- Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler
- Trained 2 classification models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Evaluated models using:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC-AUC Score
  - ROC Curve Plot
- Compared performance of both models
- Identified the better-performing classifier based on ROC-AUC

## 🏆 Outcome:
- The better model was selected based on higher ROC-AUC and generalization ability.
- ROC Curve was plotted to visually compare classifier performance.
