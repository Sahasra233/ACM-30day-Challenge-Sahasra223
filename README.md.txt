# 📊 Phase 2: Support Vector Machines (SVM) – Credit Card Fraud Detection

**ACM 30-Day AI & Data Science Challenge .


## 📁 Task Overview

- **Objective**: Train and evaluate SVM classifiers using different kernels (Linear, RBF, Polynomial) on a credit card fraud detection dataset.
- **Dataset**: [Credit Card Fraud Detection – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Deliverable**: Jupyter Notebook with SVM models, PCA visualization, accuracy scores, and kernel effect explanation.


✅ Tasks Completed :
Loaded and preprocessed the Kaggle credit card dataset.

Balanced the dataset by sampling non-fraud and fraud records.

Scaled features using StandardScaler.

Trained Support Vector Machines with:

🔹 Linear kernel

🔹 RBF kernel

🔹 Polynomial kernel

Evaluated and compared accuracy of each model.

Visualized results using 2D PCA projection for all kernels.
