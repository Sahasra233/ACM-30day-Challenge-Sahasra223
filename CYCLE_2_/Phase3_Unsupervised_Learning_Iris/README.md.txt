# 📊 Phase 3: Unsupervised Learning – Iris Clustering

### 🔁 ACM 30-Day AI & Data Science Challenge – Cycle 2: Boost & Bag

## ✅ Tasks Completed

📌 k-Means Clustering | Applied with Elbow Method to determine optimal clusters |
📌 Hierarchical Clustering | Generated dendrogram using `scipy` and performed agglomerative clustering |
📌 PCA Visualization | Used PCA to reduce dimensions from 4D to 2D for better cluster visualization |
📌 t-SNE Visualization (Bonus) | Applied t-SNE for nonlinear 2D projection and cluster separation |
📌 Cluster Visualization | Plotted clusters using seaborn for both PCA and t-SNE outputs |
📌 Real-World Applications | Included real-world use cases of clustering algorithms |

## 📊 Results

 📍 **Elbow Method** indicated 3 optimal clusters.
 📍 **Hierarchical Dendrogram** showed 3 main branches matching species.
 📍 **PCA and t-SNE** visualizations confirmed clean separation between clusters.
 📍 Clustering performance visually aligned well with true labels (for inspection only).
